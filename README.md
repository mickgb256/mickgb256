# Hi, I'm Mick 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Cyber Security Engineer** with a background in both offensive and defensive security. I spend my time focused on:

- Vulnerability management
- Incident response and making sense of our XDR
- Automation, scripting, and solution development

## 🧪 What You'll Find Here

This is my experimental zone — I write scripts and tools that I find useful either at home or in my day-to-day work. Some of it’s rough, some of it’s reusable, all of it reflects my curiosity and desire to make security more effective and more accessible.

If you find something useful: **awesome**.  
If you’ve got tips, suggestions, or ideas: **even better**.

Most of what you’ll find here is written in **PowerShell** — not always elegant, but always written with purpose. I like to build things that solve problems (or at least I thought they solved a problem when I wrote it).

## 🔐 A Bit About Me

I’m deeply passionate about security and love building or tweaking tools that help me:

- Detect threats faster
- Automate noisy or manual tasks
- Enable others to respond more effectively

I’m a fan of:

- 🐧 Linux
- 🐋 Containers
- 📉 Wazuh
- 💾 Logs (yes, really)

...but like many of us, I often view the world through **Windows**.
