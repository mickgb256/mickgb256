Hi! 
Im Mick. I love to code some stuff.

Have loved coding for years (my java is a bit rusty) but this is the first time putting out anything public (Be gentle).
See my projects and enjoy the badly coded mess! 

I am focused on creating tools that I find useful at home and in my current work environment. 
If you find anything useful, GREAT! If not thats okay feel free to post tips. 

My real passion is security and security based products. 
I love linux but like a lot of us I look at the world through windows.

You'll find a lot of my projects will be written in badly coded powershell. 

I do hope however you understand what I am trying to achieve by writing them!
